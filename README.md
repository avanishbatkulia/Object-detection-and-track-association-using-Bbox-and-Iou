# Object Tracking Task Report

## Overview
This project focuses on tracking objects in video footage by linking detected bounding boxes across frames. We implemented a filtering system to focus on high-confidence detections and specific object classes (people, bags, bottles, tables, and chairs) to optimize tracking accuracy.

## Implementation Details

### Filtering and Setup
- Set 50% confidence threshold for detections
- Filtered specific object classes:
  - Person
  - Bag
  - Bottle
  - Table
  - Chair
- Discarded low-confidence detections to reduce noise
- Focused on relevant objects to improve tracking precision

### Tracking Methods

#### 1. Bounding Box Center Distance
```markdown
- Calculates proximity between box centers across frames
- Based on spatial distance between detected objects
- Effective for well-separated objects
- Simple yet efficient approach
```

#### 2. IoU (Intersection over Union)
```markdown
- Measures bounding box overlap between frames
- Uses inverse IoU as cost metric
- Better performance with overlapping objects
- More robust in crowded scenes
```

### Implementation Features
```markdown
- Hungarian algorithm for box association
- Track management system:
  - New tracks for unmatched detections
  - Track closure after several frames of no matches
- Confidence-based filtering
- Class-specific tracking
```

## Results and Analysis

### Performance Comparison
| Method | Strength | Best Use Case |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Box Center Distance | Simple, efficient | Spread out objects |
| IoU | More accurate | Crowded scenes |

### Key Findings
```markdown
- Both methods showed similar overall performance
- IoU advantages:
  - Better handling of overlapping objects
  - More accurate in crowded scenes
- Center Distance advantages:
  - Computationally simpler
  - Effective for spread-out objects
```

### Previous Approach Limitations
```markdown
- Fixed bounding boxes without smooth updates
- Tracking lag with fast-moving objects
- Poor performance with multiple objects
```

## Conclusion
The implemented solution provides reliable object tracking through:
- Effective confidence thresholding
- Class-specific filtering
- Dual tracking methods
- Flexible approach based on scene complexity

Both tracking methods (IoU and box center distance) demonstrated strong performance, with IoU showing slight advantages in complex scenes. The filtering system played a crucial role in improving tracking quality.

## Future Improvements
- Implement hybrid approach combining both methods
- Add motion prediction
- Optimize for real-time processing
- Enhance multi-object tracking in dense scenes
